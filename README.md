# Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my academic and personal projects in Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence. Developed during my 4th-year Mathematics degree and beyond, these projects demonstrate my skills in Python, R, and tools like scikit-learn, ggplot2, and Pandas.
